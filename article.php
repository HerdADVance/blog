					<p>The climb up to my seat in the southeast corner of Albertson&rsquo;s Stadium was steeper and more tiring than one would expect at such a relatively small venue. While the crowd was respectable, Boise fans clearly weren&rsquo;t out in full force for a Friday night game against a team they expected to handle. This meant I had plenty of space.</p>

					<p>A woman close to my age who was there with what appeared to be her husband and three children.</p>

					<p>Walking through the concourse at halftime, the only Marshall fan I passed was wearing the same Moss/Pennington &lsquo;97 t-shirt that I was sporting. We pointed at each other like we were in the Spiderman meme.</p>

					<p>The 2nd half was mostly excruciating to sit through. Boise scored immediately to take their first lead at 14-7, and while I was right about that being pretty much the death knell for the Herd, I certainly didn&rsquo;t expect it to be the last score of the game. The mother, taking a break from futily attempting to keep her kids from running around the bleachers, noticed my pessimism when I didn&rsquo;t react to Tavante Beckett&rsquo;s? tipped interception.</p>

					<p>&ldquo;You can cheer for that, you know.&rdquo;</p>

					<p>My reply was a chuckle and something along the lines of &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s see what the offense can do.&rdquo; Turns out the offense couldn&rsquo;t do anything. They didn&rsquo;t get a first down the entire second half. Isaiah Green&rsquo;s 2nd interception with about 8 minutes to go would be the last time the Herd touched the ball as Boise mercilessly ground out the rest of the clock.</p>

					<p>I walked down the steep stairs one more time as Marshall&rsquo;s team walked off the field through the tunnel behind the south endzone. That section around the tunnel - close to the field below me - seemed to have a reputation as the rowdiest part of the stadium, similar to Cleveland&rsquo;s Dawg Pound. As part of what I assume to be a regular tradition, they stood and applauded the Herd players for a game effort.</p>

					<p>I briefly thought about going back to the dive bar to see what John Candy was up to, but then I remembered I needed to be at the airport in about 8 hours and decided to just make the long walk back to the AirBnB.</p>
